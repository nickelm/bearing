# Architecture decisions

Newest entries go at the bottom. Each entry records the date, the decision and the reason. If a decision is reversed, add a new entry that references the old one rather than editing history.

---

### 1. Three.js with the WebGPU renderer, not Godot or Unity

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** Build on TypeScript, Three.js (`three/webgpu`, TSL shaders) and Vite.
**Reason:**

- The game targets the browser (see 2).
- WebGPU compute shaders cover erosion, terrain baking and batched line-of-sight queries without a native engine.
- Three.js gives us a renderer without imposing a scene or simulation architecture, which matters because simulation and presentation are separate layers.
- Godot and Unity web exports are heavy, their WebGPU and compute support on the web lags behind native, and both pull the project toward engine-centric architecture.

### 2. Browser target

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** The demo runs in a desktop browser. Long-running CPU work runs in Web Workers.
**Reason:**

- A browser build is zero-install to share.
- WebGPU now ships in all major desktop browsers.
- The Gamepad API gives us flight-stick support later.

### 3. Planet radius of about 1,000 km

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** The default planet radius is 1,000 km (`PLANET_RADIUS`).
**Reason:**

- The planet's surface area is about 12.6 million km², and the farthest two points are about 3,100 km apart. That is enough room for two continents and an ocean gap, while generation stays fast and maps stay bakeable.
- At 4096² texels per cube face, a texel covers about 380 m.

### 4. Compress aircraft range, not speed

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** Aircraft ranges are scaled by a common factor (initially 0.5) by scaling fuel capacity and burn rate. Speeds, climb rates and weapon ranges stay real.
**Reason:**

- Compressing range restores the strategic depth that the small planet removes.
- Real speeds keep cockpit feel and air-combat geometry authentic.
- Shorter sorties also help pacing.

### 5. Seeded, named, independent RNG streams

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** All randomness in core, worldgen and sim comes from `rng(worldSeed, name)`.

- Seeds are expanded with SplitMix64, and each stream runs xoshiro128\*\*.
- A stream's state depends only on (seed, stream path). It is derived by hashing both with FNV-1a 64 and expanding the hash with SplitMix64.
- `fork(name)` derives a sub-stream from the path, not from the parent's current position.
- Lint bans `Math.random` in those layers.

**Reason:**

- The same seed must always produce the same world.
- Adding or changing one generation stage must not shift the random sequence of any other stage, which a single shared generator would do.
- xoshiro128\*\* is fast with 32-bit integer math in JS, and BigInt is needed only at stream creation.

### 6. WebGPU is required, with no WebGL 2 fallback

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** If WebGPU is unavailable, show an explanation and stop. Because `WebGPURenderer` silently falls back to WebGL 2, the app also checks `renderer.backend.isWebGPUBackend` after `init()`.
**Reason:** Erosion, terrain baking and line of sight depend on compute shaders. A WebGL path would be a second, crippled renderer to maintain.

### 7. TypeScript 6.0, not 7

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** Pin `typescript` to `~6.0.3`.
**Reason:** TypeScript 7.0 (the Go-native compiler) is the current npm release, but typescript-eslint 8.72 declares `typescript >=4.8.4 <6.1.0` because it depends on the JavaScript compiler API. We'll revisit once typescript-eslint supports 7.

### 8. Coordinate conventions and equi-angular cube mapping

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:**

- World frame: planet-centered Cartesian, float64, in meters. +Y points through the north pole, +Z through lat 0 / lon 0, and +X through lon 90° E, which makes the frame right-handed with east counterclockwise seen from the north.
- Geodetic altitude is measured above the reference sphere.
- Cube faces are 0..5 = +X, −X, +Y, −Y, +Z, −Z, with fixed u/v axes (u × v = outward normal).
- Faces use the equi-angular warp, `tan(π/4 · s)`.

**Reason:**

- These conventions are cheap to set now and expensive to change after maps are baked.
- With the equi-angular warp, the ratio of largest to smallest cell area across a face is under 1.5 (the test bounds it). Plain gnomonic projection gives about 5×. That keeps texel size, and therefore erosion and simulation resolution, nearly uniform over the planet.

### 9. A custom orbit camera instead of OrbitControls

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** The globe view uses `src/render/orbitCamera.ts`, which works in float64 lat/lon/altitude/tilt.

- Zoom scales altitude exponentially, from 10 km to 5,000 km.
- Drag speed scales with altitude.
- Near and far planes follow altitude: near is 0.5·h, and far is the horizon distance.

**Reason:** Three's `OrbitControls` dollies relative to the distance to the planet center, so control near the surface is unusably coarse. It also assumes the camera has a world position, which camera-relative rendering avoids.

### 10. Lint-enforced layering

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** ESLint `no-restricted-imports` enforces the layer rules.

- `core` is a leaf.
- `sim` and `worldgen` may not import `render` or `ui`.
- `sim` and `core` may not import `three/webgpu`, `three/tsl` or `lil-gui`.
- `worldgen` _may_ import `three/webgpu` and `three/tsl`.

**Reason:**

- The simulation must stay headless so it can run in a worker.
- World generation needs GPU compute for erosion and baking, which in this stack means TSL compute nodes. Allowing those packages without allowing our `render` module keeps worldgen independent of presentation code.

### 11. Vite cache outside the project tree

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** `vite.config.ts` sets `cacheDir` to `<os tmpdir>/vite-cache/bearing-<hash of project path>` instead of the default `node_modules/.vite`.
**Reason:** The repository lives in Dropbox. Vite's dependency optimizer writes `deps_temp_*` and then renames it to `deps`, and that rename failed with `EBUSY` even with `node_modules` marked as ignored by Dropbox. The pre-bundled `three/tsl` then returned 404 and the app could not load. With the cache outside the synced folder, the problem goes away, and the setup works the same on machines without Dropbox.

### 12. No generation time budget

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** Drop the design doc's 30-second limit on generation (demo goal 1). Generation may take minutes.

- Keep the fast coarse pass, so failed seeds are still rejected cheaply.
- Report per-stage progress in the UI.
- Cache finished worlds in IndexedDB from milestone 2, instead of milestone 8, so each seed and parameter set is generated once.

**Reason:** Owner's direction: world quality matters more than generation speed. Resolution choices are now limited by GPU memory, not by time.

### 13. Tiled world data from the start

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:**

- **Tile keys.** Every baked map is addressed by a tile key (face, level, x, y), which forms a quadtree per cube face. A tile is 256 × 256 texels plus a border. At level L a texel spans about 1,571 km / (256 · 2^L), which gives:
  - level 4: about 380 m, the design's 4096² per face;
  - level 7: about 48 m, the design's regional bake.
- **Global grid.** Processes that need the whole planet at once (plates, erosion and drainage, climate, rivers, the front) run on one global grid. Its resolution will be chosen by a GPU memory benchmark, with a target of 1024–2048 per face, or about 1.5–0.77 km per cell.
- **Detail tiles.** Tiles finer than the global grid are synthesized per tile on the GPU from the global maps, detail noise and a local erosion pass constrained by the global river network. Per-tile randomness comes from `fork` with the tile key.
- **Residency.** Tiles are generated on demand, kept in a GPU/CPU LRU cache with a memory budget, and persisted in IndexedDB. World generation pre-bakes the contested region to level 7.
- **Rendering.** The terrain LOD quadtree uses the same tile keys.

**Reason:**

- Holding 4096² × 6 faces × 5 maps in memory at once would take 1–2 GB, and a 50 m regional bake cannot be a single texture.
- Tiling caps resident memory, turns the regional bake into deeper levels of the same structure, and shares addressing with rendering LOD.
- The cost: tile seams need border texels and order-independent generation. The hardest part will be keeping detail tiles consistent with global drainage.

### 14. Relief scaled to the planet

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** Elevations and ocean depths are Earth-like reference values multiplied by `reliefScale` = R / R_Earth ≈ 0.157 (1,000 km / 6,371 km). The highest peaks reach about 1.4 km instead of 8.8 km, typical ranges 0.5–0.8 km, and the mean ocean depth is about 600 m. The atmosphere (scale height, density), aircraft performance and service ceilings stay real.
**Reason:** Owner's direction: mountains should look proportionate to the globe.
**Consequences:**

- Terrain no longer constrains aircraft ceilings.
- Helicopter terrain masking still works, because it depends on relief of tens of meters.
- Continental shelves become very shallow (about 20 m). Revisit before naval and submarine work after the demo.

### 15. Day and night, seasons, calendar and weather are in demo scope

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:**

- **Planet.** A 24 h solar day, 23.44° axial tilt and a 365-day year, all planet parameters. The sun direction is a stateless, analytic function of `GameTime` in `core`.
- **Calendar.** A campaign start date (day of year and time of day) maps `GameTime` 0 onto the calendar. It is a campaign parameter, not a planet parameter.
- **Climate.** The climate stage computes a seasonal temperature range from tilt and latitude, and biomes use annual means. The provisional climate in milestone 1 ignores seasons.
- **Weather.** A headless sim process runs on a coarse global grid (about 50–100 km cells), ticks hourly in game time, draws from `rng(seed, "weather")` and is driven by the climate maps. Because ticks are fixed, weather is identical at any time acceleration. The sim uses ceiling, visibility and wind for flight operations, and the renderer draws clouds from the same field.
- **Rendering.** Lighting follows the sun, the night side shows settlement lights, the snow line moves with the seasons, and clouds are now required rather than a stretch goal.

**Reason:** Owner's direction. Day, night and weather shape air operations (night sorties, weather cancellations) and the view from orbit.

### 16. Ocean gap measured coast to coast

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** The ocean gap is the shortest great-circle distance between any coastal cell of the main continent and any coastal cell of the second continent, with islands ignored. The geography check requires it to fall within `oceanGap`. Milestone 5 places ports on the facing coasts, so convoy routes come out at about the gap length or somewhat longer.
**Reason:**

- It can be measured in the coarse pass, before ports exist.
- It is simple and robust.
- An island chain in the gap (the GIUK analogue) does not break it.

Revisit if convoy crossings in milestone 7 come out too long.

### 17. Earth-like geography: near-antipodal continents, ocean fraction 0.70

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** The default `oceanFraction` is 0.70, not the design table's 0.55. Continent centers are placed about 150–175° apart, not 90–130°.

- The main continent's crust covers about 60% of the land, which gives a radius of about 50° (roughly 1,750 km across).
- The second continent covers about 30% (a radius of about 35°).
- The remaining land comes from islands and noise.
- The separation is chosen as the sum of the two radii plus the middle of the `oceanGap` range, then jittered and capped below 180°.

**Reason:**

- On a 1,000 km planet a 1,200–1,800 km gap spans 69–103° of arc.
- With centers 90–130° apart, the two continents' radii could add up to at most about 61°, covering about 15% of the surface. That conflicts with 45% land and with a main continent deep enough for a front.
- The owner chose the Earth-like resolution over keeping 0.55 or shrinking the gap.

### 18. Continents come from a crust field, with plates laid over it

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:**

- **Crust field.** Continental crust is a scalar field: the larger of two cone-shaped fields around the continent centers, plus noise. It is thresholded at the area percentile that matches the land fraction.
- **Plates.** Plates are grown independently by flood fill, with steered seeding: three seeds inside the main continent, two inside the second, and the rest spread over the oceans by best-candidate sampling.
- **Boundaries.** A boundary's type follows from the plates' relative motion and from the crust on each side.

**Reason:**

- It controls land area and continent sizes directly, which the geography check needs.
- Plate boundaries cutting through continents produce internal collision ranges, the river and mountain barriers the front generator looks for, the way India and Asia do on Earth.
- The design doc's "continental plate clusters" become plate seeds clustered inside each continent.

### 19. Climate uses reference (unscaled) elevation for lapse rate

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:**

- Temperature lapse with altitude (6.5 K/km) and the alpine and snow biomes use the Earth-like reference elevation, i.e. height ÷ `reliefScale`.
- Physical heights, rendering and flight use the scaled heights.

**Reason:** With relief scaled to the planet (decision 14), the highest peaks reach only about 1.4 km, too low for snow caps or tree lines under a real lapse rate. Using reference elevation keeps the stylized biome distribution Earth-like while the shapes stay proportionate.

### 20. Temperate, east–west elongated continents

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:**

- **Main continent.** Its center lies at 32–45° latitude, in either hemisphere.
- **Shape.** Both continents are ellipses elongated east–west. The main one is 1.8 times as wide as it is tall and the second 1.6 times, each with its long axis tilted up to 25° from east–west.
- **Placement.** The layout tries random bearings from the main continent. For each bearing, it searches the separation (100–178°) that brings the ellipse-to-ellipse gap closest to the middle of `oceanGap`, and it penalizes a second-continent center outside 22–55° latitude. Decision 17's fixed 150–175° separation no longer applies.

**Reason:**

- Map previews (`npm run maps`) showed that a round main continent covering about 18% of a 1,000 km planet spans about 100° of latitude. Centered at mid-latitudes, it reached over a pole, which produced a giant ice sheet, tundra where the front should be, and biomes in concentric rings.
- The design is modeled on Cold War Central Europe, which needs a temperate continent. Elongating the continent east–west, as Eurasia is, keeps its area while limiting how far it reaches toward the poles.

### 21. Provisional climate breaks latitude symmetry

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** The milestone-1 climate no longer depends on latitude alone.

- **Latitude warp.** Large-scale noise bends the latitude used for temperature (up to about 22°) and, separately, for the moisture bands.
- **Coasts and interiors.** Continental interiors at high latitudes run up to 7 °C colder. Open ocean far from land runs up to 9 °C warmer, a stand-in for ocean heat transport, so sea ice hugs coasts and enclosed seas.
- **Ice sheets.** Land becomes ice sheet only below −20 °C annual mean. Tundra covers −20 to −6 °C.

**Reason:** The owner's review found circular polar caps, and map previews showed biome stripes following latitude exactly. Real winds and rain shadows remain the climate stage proper in milestone 2.

### 21. Two grid resolutions: tectonic CPU grid and GPU global grid

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:**

- The CPU tectonic stages (continents, plates, boundaries, uplift, base elevation, climate) keep running on `CubeGrid` at a _tectonic resolution_ (default 512 per face).
- The _global grid_ (1024 or 2048 per face, chosen by benchmark) is a set of flat GPU storage buffers with `CubeGrid`'s index layout, `(face · N + j) · N + i`. It is filled by seam-aware bicubic upsampling of the tectonic maps plus detail noise, and then eroded.
- Neighbors on the global grid are computed from (face, i, j) by `core/faceAdjacency.ts`, with no tables. Crossing a face edge is an integer remap, derived from `CUBE_FACES`, and the tests check it against `CubeGrid.neighbors4`.

**Reason:** `CubeGrid` stores float64 centers and neighbor tables, about 80 bytes per cell: about 500 MB at 1024² per face and 2 GB at 2048². Plate growth and the Dijkstra distance fields also do not need kilometer resolution, because their outputs are smooth.

### 22. GPU world generation runs on the render device, on the main thread

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** GPU stages (detail noise, erosion, tile baking and synthesis) run on the main thread's `WebGPURenderer`. Work is dispatched in chunks between frames, so the UI keeps rendering. CPU stages stay in the worldgen worker. The renderer requests the adapter's maximum storage-buffer limits.
**Reason:** Baked tiles must end up as render textures. Using the same device avoids a GPU → CPU → GPU copy per tile, and three's renderer in a worker would be a second device with its own pipelines. The main thread only records and submits work, so it stays responsive.

### 23. Stream-power erosion on the global grid; drainage recomputed on the CPU

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:**

- Global erosion is a stream-power model: tectonic uplift, fluvial incision `K · P · A^m · S^n` (P precipitation, A drainage area, S slope), low-slope deposition, and a talus-angle thermal pass. It is not a particle or virtual-pipe water simulation.
- Flow accumulation on the GPU gathers from donors (no float atomics), so a run is deterministic on a given GPU and driver. Bit-exact results across GPUs are not guaranteed.
- After erosion the height map is read back. Flow directions, accumulation, lakes and rivers are recomputed exactly on the CPU (priority flood, D8), because the sim and the front generator depend on them.

**Reason:** At 0.8–1.5 km cells, stream power is the model geomorphologists use at this scale. It produces dendritic drainage and a consistent drainage area directly. Particle erosion carves features that are finer than one cell. Bit-exact GPU determinism across vendors is not achievable with float math, so the data the sim depends on comes from a deterministic CPU pass. IndexedDB caching (decision 12) means each machine generates a given world once.

### 24. Detail tiles are a pure function of direction

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** Below the global grid's level, a tile texel's height is `f(direction)`:

- bicubic global height;
- ridged and warped detail noise, scaled by uplift;
- an analytic erosion filter: gullies aligned with the global slope, attenuated along global rivers;
- river channels carved from the vector rivers, using their widths.

This replaces the TODO's "local erosion pass" on each tile. The same function exists in TypeScript (`worldgen/terrainHeight.ts`) for tests, the camera ground clamp and the sim. `fork(tileKey)` is reserved for features entirely inside one tile, because noise seeded per tile would break seams.
**Reason:** A per-tile erosion simulation disagrees with its neighbors along shared edges unless tiles are generated with overlapping, blended windows. That costs about 4× the work and still depends on generation order at face seams. A pure function makes tiles order-independent and seam-free by construction, and lets headless code query the same terrain the renderer draws.

### 25. Tile texels addressed by integer global texel index

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** Tile synthesis computes a texel's face coordinate as `u = (gx + 0.5) / (256 · 2^L)`, with the integer `gx = x · 256 + tx`. It does not add a fractional offset to the tile origin.
**Reason:** Two tiles that share a texel then compute bit-identical inputs within a face, so shared border texels agree exactly. Across face seams the same direction comes from different face coordinates, so agreement there is only to within rounding. Skirts cover the difference.

### 26. World-generation kernels are plain WGSL, tested in Node on Dawn

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:**

- GPU world-generation kernels are written in plain WGSL and run on a raw `GPUDevice` through `worldgen/gpu/gpuContext.ts`. They do not use TSL compute nodes.
- In the browser the device is three's own (`renderer.backend.device`), which keeps decision 22. In Vitest and offline tools it comes from Dawn's Node bindings, the `webgpu` dev dependency.
- GPU tests skip themselves when no adapter is available.
- Kernel checks are written once as self-tests (`worldgen/gpu/selfTests.ts`). They run in Vitest and from a GUI button in the browser, which catches browser shader compilers that disagree with Dawn.
- This supersedes part of decision 24: detail tiles do **not** get a TypeScript twin. Seam tests run on the GPU in Vitest. The camera ground clamp reads the CPU copies of resident tiles. How the sim queries terrain will be decided in M6.

**Reason:**

- GPU code can then be tested automatically, rather than only by eye in a browser.
- WGSL is far easier to write and review than node graphs for kernels the size of stream-power erosion or multi-octave noise.
- Two implementations of the detail-height function would drift apart.

**Notes (webgpu 0.6.2, Windows):** `queue.onSubmittedWorkDone()` and error scopes used after a buffer has been mapped both crash the Node process. `GpuContext.finish()` waits on a 4-byte readback instead, and errors are collected from the `uncapturederror` event.

### 27. Global grid resolution: 1024² per face

**Date:** 2026-11-09
**Decision:** The global grid is 1024 × 1024 cells per face (6.3 M cells, about 1.5 km per cell, tile level 2). 2048² stays available as an option for powerful machines, but it is not the default.
**Reason:** `tools/bench.preview.ts`, run on Dawn on the owner's desktop (AMD RDNA 3, D3D12), measured:

| Global grid | Cells  | Peak GPU memory in maps | Detail + upsample | Erosion per iteration | 1,200 iterations |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1024²       | 6.3 M  | 264 MiB                 | 0.17 s            | 21 ms                 | about 26 s       |
| 2048²       | 25.2 M | 1,056 MiB               | 1.2 s             | 123 ms                | about 147 s      |

- 1 GiB of GPU memory is out of reach for mid-range laptops, whose integrated GPUs share system RAM.
- The CPU drainage and river pass also scales with cell count: at 2048² it would need about 330 MB of typed arrays in the worker.
- A mid-range laptop GPU is perhaps 3–5× slower than this desktop, so 1024² still finishes erosion in one to two minutes, within decision 12.
- Detail below 1.5 km comes from tile synthesis (decision 24), so the global grid only has to carry drainage-scale structure.
